# Project organization

In this section we'll describe how we organized the work for this report.

We started the domain analysis and debating which classes should be present in this software. We then created a class diagram and activity diagrams.

As we're 4 in the group, Axel the manager of this phase took responsibility for the class diagram with the help of Florent and Keven and let Florine
work on the activity diagrams in parallel because she offered herself. You can find a recap of who was responsible of which diagram in the following table :

|                           | Axel | Keven | Florent | Florine |
|---------------------------|------|-------|---------|---------|
| Class diagram             |  x   |   x   |    x    |         |
| Loan activity diagram     |      |       |         |    x    |
| Return activity diagram   |      |       |         |    x    |
| Book activity diagram     |      |       |         |    x    |

Once we finished diagrams and management report, Florent compiled everything in a single PDF that you're currently reading.
