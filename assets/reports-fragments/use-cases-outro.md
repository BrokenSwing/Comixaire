# Project organization

> Note: This section is not a use case description

In this section we'll describe how we organized the work for this report.

We started brain storming and debating which use cases should be present in this software. We then dropped all our ideas
in a Google document and flattened all of this regrouping our use cases ideas under 12 categories (which each of is a section of this report).

As we're 4 in the group, we spread the uses cases between us for a total of 3 use case per person. You can find a recap of who was responsible of which use case in the following table :

|                           | Axel | Keven | Florent | Florine |
|---------------------------|------|-------|---------|---------|
| Authentication            |      |       |    x    |         |
| Booking                   |  x   |       |         |         |
| Clients and subscriptions |      |       |         |    x    |
| Logs                      |      |   x   |         |         |
| Employees CRUD            |      |       |         |    x    |
| Fines CRUD                |      |       |         |    x    |
| Items CRUD                |      |   x   |         |         |
| Items search              |      |   x   |         |         |
| Items rating              |      |       |    x    |         |
| Loans                     |  x   |       |         |         |
| Recommendations           |      |       |    x    |         |
| Returns                   |  x   |       |         |         |

Each of us made diagrams for its use cases and redacted the detailled description of the use cases. Then we started to create mock-ups, it's Florine and Axel that made the base design for the mock-ups and after that, all of use modified the base design to create mock ups that were matching our use-cases descriptions.

Once we had all mock ups and use-cases descriptions, Florent compiled everything in a single PDF that you're currently reading.
