# Introduction

This report contains the domain analysis for the project *Comixaire* made by **Duval Axel**, **Dvorianoff Keven**, **Hugouvieux Florent** and **Pralong Florine**.

Here is a little abstract of the *Comixaire* project :

> Comixaire is a library management software that is aimed to be used mainly by libraries employees. In the scope of this project
> we will suppose library's clients have direct access to the software but in a real use case, clients would only have a terminal
> where they could scan their library membership card.
> 
> This software will allow to manage clients subscriptions to the library and loans.
> This software won't only support books but many items like games, newpapers, CDs, DVDs, etc ...
